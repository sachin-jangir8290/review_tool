          "text": "Los Banos Roofing did some emergency work for me during a storm and my experience with them was exceptional. They came out promptly, did a thorough evaluation of all of the problems they observed on my roof not just the current leak, but problems that had clearly been there for years that other roofers missed. They gave me an estimate, which felt very reasonable to me considering how much I have paid in the past for roof repairs. They scheduled the work, arrived on time, performed the work without fail, and took pictures of all of the work before and after to confirm that the work had been done. They then followed up with me a week later during another storm to confirm that they had indeed successfully repaired my roof. I have been searching for years for a responsive and ethical roofing company and I feel so grateful to have found Los Banos Roofing. I will call them in a heartbeat the next time I have roofing issues.",

          "text": "Recently, I discovered a leak in my roof beneath the solar panels, caused by a cracked tile due to subpar work by the solar company. I hired Los Banos Roofing to address the issue. They replaced the damaged tile and added new waterproof underlayment across the entire area where the solar panels are located. I’m thrilled with the quality of their work, and the price was very fair.\n\nIsis and Juan were a pleasure to deal with. Juan and his team worked quickly and efficiently, wasting no time. After the job was done, Isis followed up with a call to ensure we had no concerns or questions.\n\nI wholeheartedly recommend Los Banos Roofing!",

She and Juan came to house and inspected roof. Much to my surprise Juan said roof was actually in pretty good shape and just needed some maintenance. Scheduled the maintenance with them and even has them change roof on our shed. They scheduled work within a week and kept me posted frequently. Work done was superb, timely and very clean.
